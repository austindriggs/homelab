# Jellyfin

Jellyfin is used to manage media via a modern interface:
- Access my parents large DVD collection of shows and movies that I've ripped. 
- Homemade videos from Christmas, soccer, vacations (skydiving, snorkeling), and other occasions.
- The homemade videos are also being backup up on the cloud (privately) on our YouTube accounts.
- Backup and provide access to my offline Spotify local files.
