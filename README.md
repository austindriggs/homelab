# Austin's Homelab

My apartment-lab (really just a NAS) documentation. Hopefully one day with config files and such.

Goals:
- Sync and backup files, (my and my parents) pictures/videos, and projects.
- Document the things and processes I'm doing:  It would be nice for someone to be able to understand how to access and maintain my things, or even replicate it.


## DEVICES

Current:
- ZimaBlade 7700 (with external USB fan)
- Apple TV (ran over Ethernet)

Future:
- Immich Frame
- Offsite backup


## INITIAL R&D

- This is the video that convinced me to get the ZimaBlade: [Tiny NAS! ZimaBlade NAS Kit Review - Jellyfin Install, Linux/CasaOS, & 2 NAS HDDs](https://youtu.be/2eP0ff2nmIM?si=lQh1YlRYHEZL2oJK) by [Tek Syndicate](https://www.youtube.com/@teksyndicate).
- Another helpful video: [Home Servers Have NEVER Been This Easy: CasaOS + ZimaBoard](https://youtu.be/w44CypRO5l4?si=K86x_VdJyfkrF_5P) by [Hardware Haven](https://www.youtube.com/@HardwareHaven)
- I've learned a lot about networking and this is one of the best intro videos that covers a bunch of different topics: [Everything I Learned About Home Networking - A Newbieâ€™s Perspective](https://youtu.be/DT2ARc1NOpM?si=a5K2GU-9xXWb3N7d) by [Jimmy Tries World](https://www.youtube.com/@JimmyTriesWorld) on YouTube
